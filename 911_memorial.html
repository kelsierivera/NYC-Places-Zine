	<p>The terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 is something that New Yorkers will never forget. Thousands of people were either killed, injured or have suffered lifelong illnesses; including civilians, firefighters, and police officers. With the twin towers gone, we have a new structure to honor those we lost. There is a memorial with each victims name engraved on the borders and a beautiful waterfall flowing in the middle.</p>

	  <p>We honor those who died in this tragic attack via the 9/11 Memorial site. It is over 1000,000 square feet and cost $700 million to build. Those funds came from private and public donations. There is also a museum which people can buy tickets to enter and see over 20,000 images, 10,000 artifacts, 500 hours of moving images and much more. The attacks on September 11, 2001 are truly is an attack that Americans will never forget.  </p>
