	<h3>WELCOME TO NYCPLACES.COM!</h3>
	<p>Our goal is to provide people with information about amazing places located throughout New York City. New York City is visited by millions of people every year from various places from all over the world. We wanted to be able to provide those who are unfamiliar with New York City, some information to help make their stay more adventerous. We understand that when visiting a place that you may be unfamiliar with, it may be hard to know what to do, but that is where we come in! Our articles are about places that we feel will let you leave New York with the feeling of knowing that you truly experienced some great places that make New York City what it is.

	<p>In our articles we provide pictures, a little bit of history, fun / interesting facts, and most importantly travel information. New York provides multiple options for travel such as the Subway, Ferry, PATH train, biking or just good old fashion walking. We also provide with you with pricing information since we are aware that there are people taking advantage of tourist and charging them for things that are completely free!</p>
